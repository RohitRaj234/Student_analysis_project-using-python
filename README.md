# Student Analysis Project
## Overview

This repository contains a student analysis project implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization. The project explores a dataset related to student information, performs data cleaning, conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generates visualizations to gain insights into various aspects of the data.

Project Structure
Student_Analysis_Project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main analysis code.
students.csv: Sample dataset (replace with your own dataset).
cleaned_students.csv: Output file after data cleaning (optional).
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.
Data
The project uses a dataset (students.csv) containing information about students. Replace this file with your own dataset if needed.

Analysis Steps
Import Necessary Libraries: Import pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
Load the Dataset: Read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Explore the Data: Check the structure of the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, etc.
Basic Statistics: Display basic statistics of numerical columns.
Visualization: Create visualizations to gain insights into the data.
Grouping and Aggregation: Group the data and perform aggregations.
Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between different variables.

Conclusion: Summarize findings and insights.
